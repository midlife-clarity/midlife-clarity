- 👋 Hi, I’m @midlife-clarity
- 👀 I’m interested in learning random useless facts that some may find interesting. Fun fact, the Naked Mole Rat is the only known cold blooded mammal. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to set routines and habits. Hopefully it transitions to my education in coding. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small simple apps.
- 📫 How to reach me COMING SOON
